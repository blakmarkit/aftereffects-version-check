# aftereffects-version-check
A Python script to determine the After Effects Version used to save the project.

I share this little script in the expectation that the community shares more data on the different After Effects builds.

## How to run
py afx-version-check.py PROJECTFILE.aep

## Examples
Under the folder **aftereffects_projects** there are some project files to test the script
